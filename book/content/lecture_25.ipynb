However, these methods assume predefined model formsâ€”linear or logistic in nature. Symbolic Regression offers a data-driven discovery of both the structure and parameters of the relationship between variables, without imposing a fixed functional form.\n",

    "## What is Symbolic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic regression is a form of regression analysis that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset. Unlike linear or logistic regression, symbolic regression does not start with a predetermined equation structure. Instead, it uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve candidate equations that can model the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines principles from:\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: For automated model discovery.\n",
    "- **Genetic Programming**: To evolve symbolic representations.\n",
    "- **Classical Regression**: To fit parameters within the discovered structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic regression is particularly useful when:\n",
    "- The underlying relationship between variables is unknown.\n",
    "- We suspect the relationship is non-linear or involves interactions not easily captured by standard models.\n",
    "- Interpretability of the resulting model is important.\n"
