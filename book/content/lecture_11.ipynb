    "#### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean value z-test evaluates whether a sample mean significantly differs from a hypothesized population mean, under the assumption that,\n",
    "\n",
    "- population variance is known \n",
    "- sampled observations are independent and randomly drawn from the population\n",
    "- distribution of the sample means is approximately normal (either due to a large sample size or the underlying population being normal)\n",

    "#### Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic $(z)$ in a z-test quantifies the deviation of the sample mean from the population mean in units of the standard error as follows, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = (\\hat{\\mu} - \\mu_o) / (\\sigma / \\sqrt{n})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\mu}$ is the sample mean\n",
    "- $\\mu_o$ is the hypothesized population mean\n",

    "#### Rejection Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis can be rejected on the basis of rejection region $(\\text{RR})$ of the test statistic $(z)$, which defines the set of values for $z$ that are considered highly improbable under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. To this end, if the computed test statistic falls within this rejection region $(z \\in \\text{RR})$, then the null hypothesis can be rejected. Note, for a two-tailed test, the rejection region is given by $(-\\infty, -z_{\\alpha/2}) \\cup (z_{\\alpha/2}, \\infty)$. In contrast, for a one-tailed test, $(-\\infty, -z_{\\alpha})$ forms the rejection region in a left-tailed test, and $(z_{\\alpha}, \\infty)$ in a right-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the null hypothesis can be rejected on the basis of the confidence interval $(\\text{CI})$, which provides a range of plausible values for the population mean $(\\mu_o)$ under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. To this end, if the population mean lies outside the confidence interval $(\\mu_o \\notin \\text{CI})$, then the null hypothesis can be rejected. Note, for a two-tailed test, the confidence interval is given by $[\\hat{\\mu} - z_{\\alpha / 2}(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}), \\hat{\\mu} + z_{\\alpha / 2}(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n})]$. In contrast, for a one-tailed test, $(-\\infty, \\hat{\\mu} + z_{\\alpha}(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}))$ forms the confidence interval in a left-tailed test, and $(\\hat{\\mu} - z_{\\alpha}(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n})), \\infty)$ in a right-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, p-value is the smallest value of significance level ($\\alpha$) for which we can reject the null hypothesis. A high p-value implies that the observed data is reasonably consistent under the presumption of the null hypothesis, thereby compelling us to not reject it. On the other hand, a low p-value signifies that the observed outcome is highly improbable under the presumption of null hypothesis, thereby supporting its rejection beyond a reasonable doubt.\n",

    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "An automobile manufacturer claims that its electric SUV has a real-world range of 500kms. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) conducts 100 range tests, rendering a mean of 485kms. Given population standard deviation of 25kms, test the claim at 5% significance level.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $H_o$: The electric SUV meets the claimed range ($\\mu \\geq 500$)\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $H_a$: The electric SUV falls short of the claimed range ($\\mu < 500$)\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test statistic is computed as, $z = (485 - 500) / (25 / \\sqrt{100}) = -6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this a left-tailed test, at 5% siginifcance level, the rejection region is given by, $\\text{RR} = (-\\infty, -1.645)$. Since, $z \\in RR \\Rightarrow \\text{reject} \\ H_o$.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, for this a left-tailed test, the confidence interval is given by, $\\text{CI} = (-\\infty, 485 + 1.645 \\times (25 / \\sqrt{100})) = (-\\infty, 489.1)$. Since, $\\mu_o \\notin \\text{CI} \\Rightarrow \\text{reject} \\ H_o$\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the p-value for this test is 0.0000001%, implying that there is a one in a billion chance of observing such an outcome under the presumption of the null hypothesis, thereby compelling us to reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, based on the observed outcomes, the electric SUV fails to meet the claimed range of 500kms, beyond a reasonable doubt. Note, this reasonable doubt emerges from a 5% possibility of rejecting a true null hypothesis - Type I error. \n",
