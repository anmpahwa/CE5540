    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The NaSch Cellular Automaton (short for Nagel–Schreckenberg model) is one of the most widely used cellular automata models to study vehicular traffic flow. Here, space is discretized into cells (1D Lattice) wherein each cell is either empty or occupied by exactly one vehicle, while time progresses in discrete steps, rendering discrete vehicle speeds. It was proposed in 1992 by Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg as a microscopic, stochastic traffic model, designed to capture essential dynamics of highway traffic while being simple enough for large-scale simulation.\n",

    "- Location: $x_i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speed: $v_i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavioral Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acceleration: $v_i(t + \\Delta t) \\rightarrow \\min (v_i(t) + 1, \\bar{v})$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deceleration: $v_i(t + \\Delta t) \\rightarrow \\min (v_i(t), h_i(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic Braking: $v_i(t + \\Delta t) \\rightarrow \\max (v_i(t) - 1, 0)$ with probability $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movement: $x_i(t + \\Delta t) \\rightarrow x_i(t) + v_i(t + \\Delta t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization: Define road length $l$, maximum velocity $\\bar{v}$, braking probability $p$, and number of vehicle $n$. Randomly assign vehicle positions $x_i(0)$ and initial speed $v_i(0) \\in [0, \\bar{v}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perception: Each vehicle observes its immediate leader, computes its headway $h_i(t)$, and notes its current speed $v_i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-Making: Accelerate if possible; Decelerate to maintain safe distance; Randomization (stochastic braking)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Update each vehicle's position\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment Update: Resolve the new lattice configuration (occupied and empty cells), ensuring synchronous updates for all vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iteration: Repeat steps for each time step until the simulation horizon $k$ is reached. Collect metrics (flow, density, average speed, jam length).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emergent Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free Flow: At low densities, car move at a speed close to $v_{max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traffic Jams: At higher densities, jams form spontaneously due to the randomization rule\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase Transition: The model shows a transition from free flow to congested traffic as density increases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop-and-Go Waves: Jam fronts propagate backward through traffic, resembling real highway observations.\n",
