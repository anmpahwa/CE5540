    "## Interpreting Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple interpretations of what probability means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical Interpretation**: Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "- **Frequency Interpretation**: Probability is the long-run relative frequency of an event occurring in repeated trials.\n",
    "- **Subjective Interpretation**: Probability represents personal belief or degree of certainty about an event.\n",
    "- **Propensity Interpretation**: Probability is a measure of the tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "All interpretations aim to provide a consistent way of reasoning about uncertainty.\n",

    "Before we can dive deeper into the probaility theory, let's cover some basics of set theory,\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is deeply rooted in **set theory**, where outcomes of experiments are represented as sets. Some key set operations include,\n",
    "- **Union** ($A \\cup B$): All elements in $A$, in $B$, or in both.\n",
    "- **Intersection** ($A \\cap B$): All elements common to both $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "- **Complement** ($A^c$): All elements not in $A$.\n",
    "- **Difference** ($A - B$): Elements in $A$ but not in $B$.\n",
    "- **Subset**: $A \\subseteq B$ means every element in $A$ is also in $B$.\n",
    "- **Disjoint Sets**: $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "Set operations obey the follwing laws, \n",
    "- **Commutativity**: This law states that the order of the sets does not matter when performing union or intersection.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These axioms render the following laws of probability,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complement Rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$ follows from Axiom #2 and Axiom #3\n",
    "- **Monotonicity**: If $A \\subset B$, then $P(A) \\leq P(B)$ follows from Axiom #3\n",

For example, in screening for a disease, the natural way to calibrate a test is to see how well it does at detecting the disease when the disease is present, and to see how often it raises false alarms when the disease is not present. These are, respectively, the conditional probability of detecting the disease given that the disease is present, and the conditional probability of incorrectly raising an alarm given that the disease is not present. However, the interesting quantity for an individual is the conditional chance that he or she has the disease, given that the test raised an alarm. \n",

Assuming 1% of the population has the disease, what’s the probability that a person does have the disease given that they tested positive?\n",

    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall Problem is a classic example of how human intuition often goes against probabilistic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're on a game show, wherein there are 3 doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), while behind the other two doors are goats. You pick one door (say, Door #1), then the host (Monty Hall), who knows what’s behind all the doors, opens another door (say, Door #3), which has a goat. Monty then gives you a choice: Stick with your original pick (Door #1), or Switch to the remaining unopened door (Door #2).\n",

    "**Solution:** Most people think the chances are now 50-50 between the two remaining doors, but this intuition is wrong. When you initially picked a door, your chance of picking the car was 1/3, while the change of picking a goat was 2/3. Since Monty will always open a door with a goat, giving you information, thus if your original pick was wrong (2/3 chance), switching will win you the car, however, if your original pick was right (1/3 chance), switching will lose you the car. Essentially, the probability of winning if you switch is 2/3, whereas sticking keeps you at 1/3. The table below details these possible set of events.\n",
