    "## Interpreting Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple interpretations of what probability means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical Interpretation**: Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "- **Frequency Interpretation**: Probability is the long-run relative frequency of an event occurring in repeated trials.\n",
    "- **Subjective Interpretation**: Probability represents personal belief or degree of certainty about an event.\n",
    "- **Propensity Interpretation**: Probability is a measure of the tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "All interpretations aim to provide a consistent way of reasoning about uncertainty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Probability theory is deeply rooted in **set theory**, where outcomes of experiments are represented as sets. Some key set operations include,\n",
    "- **Union** ($A \\cup B$): All elements in $A$, in $B$, or in both.\n",
    "- **Intersection** ($A \\cap B$): All elements common to both $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "- **Complement** ($A^c$): All elements not in $A$.\n",
    "- **Difference** ($A - B$): Elements in $A$ but not in $B$.\n",
    "- **Subset**: $A \\subseteq B$ means every element in $A$ is also in $B$.\n",
    "- **Disjoint Sets**: $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "Set operations obey the follwing laws, \n",

    "## The Monty Hall Problem: A Probability Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall Problem is a classic example of how human intuition often goes against probabilistic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're on a game show, wherein there are 3 doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), while behind the other two doors are goats. You pick one door (say, Door #1), then the host (Monty Hall), who knows what’s behind all the doors, opens another door (say, Door #3), which has a goat. Monty then gives you a choice: Stick with your original pick (Door #1), or Switch to the remaining unopened door (Door #2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Should you switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people think the chances are now 50-50 between the two remaining doors, but this intuition is wrong. When you initially picked a door, your chance of picking the car was 1/3, while the change of picking a goat was 2/3. Since Monty will always open a door with a goat, giving you information, thus if your original pick was wrong (2/3 chance), switching will win you the car, however, if your original pick was right (1/3 chance), switching will lose you the car. Essentially, the probability of winning if you switch is 2/3, whereas sticking keeps you at 1/3. The table below details these possible set of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Initial Pick | Car Location | Monty Opens | Switch Wins? |\n",
