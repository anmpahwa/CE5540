    "Given a box with a total $n$ tickets, wherein $p$ proportion of tickets are labeled as 1 while $1-p$ are labeled as 0, then a total of $k$ draws of tickets (with replacement) can render a sample sum of lables $S$. The probability that this sum takes a specific value $s \\in [0,k]$ is contingent of the number of tickets labeled 0 and 1. Specifically, this probability is equivalent to drawing $s$ tickets labeled as 1 out of a total $k$ draws. Since each draw is an identical, indepedent, random (IIR) event, this proability can be evaluated as, $p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)}$ $_nC_k$"

    "## The Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall Problem is a classic example of how human intuition often goes against probabilistic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're on a game show, wherein there are 3 doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), while behind the other two doors are goats. You pick one door (say, Door #1), then the host (Monty Hall), who knows what’s behind all the doors, opens another door (say, Door #3), which has a goat. Monty then gives you a choice: Stick with your original pick (Door #1), or Switch to the remaining unopened door (Door #2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Should you switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Most people think the chances are now 50-50 between the two remaining doors, but this intuition is wrong. When you initially picked a door, your chance of picking the car was 1/3, while the change of picking a goat was 2/3. Since Monty will always open a door with a goat, giving you information, thus if your original pick was wrong (2/3 chance), switching will win you the car, however, if your original pick was right (1/3 chance), switching will lose you the car. Essentially, the probability of winning if you switch is 2/3, whereas sticking keeps you at 1/3. The table below details these possible set of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Initial Pick | Car Location | Monty Opens | Switch Wins? |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Door 1       | Door 1       | Door 2/3    | ❌            |\n",
