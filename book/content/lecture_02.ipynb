    "In the previous lecture, we had a brief discussion about summarizing data. In this lecture, we will dive deeper into this subject - specifically, exploring ways to summarize quantitative data through measures of location, dispersion, and shape.\n",

    "## Measures of Location (MoL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Location aim to capture the nature of data through a single-value representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic mean represents the expected (average) value of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete quantitative data, let there be $n$ distinct discrete values such that each discrete value $x_i$ has an associated frequency $f_i$, rendering probability mass function as $f(x_i) = f_i / \\sum_i f_i$, then the mean is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous quantitative data with probability density function $f(x)$, the mean is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\int f(x)x \\ \\ dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the number that divides the (ordered) data in half. At least half the data are equal to or smaller than the median, and at least half the data are equal to or greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete quantitative data arranged in an ascending order, let there be $n$ distinct discrete values such that each discrete value $x_i$ has an associated frequency $f_i$, then the median is given by \\alpha_{p=0.5} as follows,\n",

    "$$x_l: \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} f_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i} < p \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i} \\geq p$$\n",
    "$$x_u: \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} f_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i} \\leq p \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i} > p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "if $x_l$ and $x_u$ exist, then $\\alpha_{p} = (x_l + x_u) / 2$;\n",
    "else if only $x_l$ exists, then $\\alpha_{p} = x_l$;\n",
    "else $\\alpha_{p} = x_u$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous quantitative data grouped into $n$ intervals of width $w$ (arranged in an ascending order), each with frequency $f_i$, such that the median $\\lambda$ lies in the median class $X_m: [mw, (m+1)w]$, then this median is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = mw + w(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i / 2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} f_i) / f_m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode of a set of data is the most common value among the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete quantitative data, let there be $n$ distinct discrete values such that each discrete value $x_i$ has an associated frequency $f_i$, then the mode is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = \\text{argmax}f_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous quantitative data grouped into $n$ intervals of width $w$ (arranged in an ascending order), each with frequency $f_i$, such that the mode $\\gamma$ lies in the modal class $X_m: [mw, (m+1)w]$, the median is given by, the mode is given by,\n",

    "```{tip}\n",
    "For qualitative and categorical data, mean and median lack any statistical significance, however, mode can be defined.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the mean and the median need not be close together. If the data has a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are exactly equal, but if the distribution of the data is skewed, the difference between mean and the median can be large. Specifically, the median is smaller than the mean if the data are skewed to the right, and larger than the mean if the data are skewed to the left.\n",
