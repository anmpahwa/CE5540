    "# Lecture 34: Car-Following Models\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This lecture introduces car-following models as a microscopic, agent-based approach to simulating traffic flow. We will explore the fundamental logic of car-following, differentiate between key model families (stimulus–response, safety distance, optimal velocity, and intelligent driver models), and discuss their data requirements and equilibria conditions. The lecture ends with a discussion on simulation mechanism, specifically, the Cellular Automata model - an agent-based simulation.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In car-following models, each vehicle–driver unit is represented as an agent characterized by three essential components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perception: The agent continuously monitors its environment, particularly the headway (distance to the leading vehicle) and relative speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision rules: Based on perceived stimuli, the agent applies behavioral rules that determine acceleration, deceleration, or maintaining speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints: Decisions are bounded by physical and psychological factors such as vehicle performance limits, driver comfort, and safety margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike macroscopic traffic flow models, which treat traffic as a continuous fluid, car-following models capture microscopic heterogeneity in driver behavior, reaction delays, and local interactions among vehicles. These seemingly simple interactions can generate emergent phenomena such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop-and-go waves that propagate backward through traffic (phantom traffic jams).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capacity drops at bottlenecks due to over-reaction or delayed acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instabilities in traffic streams that magnify small disturbances into large-scale congestion patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car-following therefore provides a bridge between driver psychology and system-level traffic dynamics, making it a cornerstone of agent-based traffic simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schematic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate the modeling framework, consider the following schematic setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ego vehicle $(i)$: The agent being modeled, with position $x_i(t)$, speed $v_i(t)$, and acceleration $a_i(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leader vehicle $(i–1)$: The vehicle directly ahead, with position $x_{i-1}(t)$ and speed $v_{i-1}(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headway (gap): The space between the ego and leader vehicles, defined as $h_i(t) = x_{i-1}(t) - x_i(t) - L$, where $L$ is the vehicle length\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative speed (closing rate): $\\Delta v_i(t) = v_i(t) - v_{i-1}(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ego vehicle’s acceleration decision can then be expressed as a function of these inputs: $a_i(t) = f\\left(h_i(t), \\Delta v_i(t), v_i(t)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This schematic highlights the agent–environment interaction loop: perception (headway, relative speed) → decision (acceleration) → system evolution (updated speeds, positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Car-following models can be grouped into several families, each based on different behavioral assumptions and mathematical formulations. These models describe how the acceleration of a vehicle (ego) is determined as a function of headway, relative speed, and sometimes additional factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stimulus–Response Models (SRM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest family of car-following models assumes that drivers react proportionally to a stimulus, typically the relative speed with respect to the leader. The acceleration of vehicle $i$ is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_i(t + \\tau) = \\alpha \\Delta v_i(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "- $a_i$: acceleration of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $\\tau$: reaction time\n",
    "- $\\alpha$: sensitivity parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework captures the delay in driver reactions, but ignores the effect of absolute spacing, which can lead to unrealistic collisions if not corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety Distance Models (SDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety-distance models emphasize maintaining a minimum safe headway. A classic example is the Newell’s model, which specifies that a vehicle adapts its speed to ensure a time-gap to the leader:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_i(t) = \\min(v_o, h_i(t) / T) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "- $v_o$: free flow speed \n",
    "- $h_i$: headway of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $T$: desired time headway\n",
    "\n",
    "These models focus on collision avoidance and enforce stability by guaranteeing that drivers do not follow too closely. However, they may oversimplify dynamic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal‑Velocity Model (OVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_i(t) = \\alpha \\left(v(h_i(t)) - v_i(t)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "- $a_i$: acceleration of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $h_i$: headway of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $\\alpha$: sensitivity parameter\n",
    "- $v(h_i(t))$: optimal velocity function, given as, $v(h_i(t)) = \\bar{v} \\tanh(h_i(t) /h_c - 1)$\n",
    "- $\\bar{v}$: maximum speed\n",
    "- $h_c$: critical spacing\n",
    "\n",
    "OVM models capture emergent stop-and-go waves and are widely used in theoretical traffic flow analysis. However, they may exhibit instability unless parameters are carefully chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDM family combines realism and mathematical smoothness. The acceleration rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_i(t) = \\bar{a} \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{v_i(t)}{v_o}\\right)^{\\delta}-\\left(\\frac{h^*(v_i(t),\\Delta v_i(t))}{h_i(t)}\\right)^2\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "- $a_i$: acceleration of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $h_i$: headway of vehicle $i$ \n",
    "- $v_o$: free flow speed \n",
    "- $\\delta$: acceleration exponent (typically, 4)\n",
    "- $h^*$: desired dynamic spacing, given by, $h^*(v_i(t),\\Delta v_i(t)) = h_0 + v_i(t)T + \\frac{v_i(t)\\,\\Delta v_i(t)}{2\\sqrt{\\bar{a}d}}$\n",
    "- $T$: desired time headway\n",
    "- $\\bar{a}$: maximum acceleration\n",
    "- $bd$: comfortable deceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDM elegantly blends free-flow acceleration and car-following behavior, ensuring collision avoidance, realistic deceleration, and smooth transitions. It has become a benchmark model for both traffic flow theory and microscopic simulation platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Car-following models rely on microscopic trajectory data that capture the dynamics of individual vehicles. Key data elements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicle trajectories: Longitudinal positions x_i(t), velocities v_i(t), and accelerations a_i(t) recorded at high frequency (e.g., 10 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headways and gaps: Spacing between consecutive vehicles, typically derived from position differences or range sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative speeds: Closing rates (\\Delta v_i(t)) between leader and follower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicle attributes: Length, maximum acceleration, braking capacity, and desired speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Driver attributes: Desired headway, reaction time, and aggressiveness (inferred from behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern sources of such data include instrumented vehicles, radar/lidar sensors, differential GPS, and large-scale datasets like NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation, FHWA) or trajectory extractions from drone-based video. These data are critical not only for developing models but also for calibrating and validating them against observed driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental property of car-following models is their ability to represent equilibrium traffic flow, where all vehicles travel at constant speed and equal spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equilibrium condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_i(t) = 0, \\quad \\Delta v_i(t) = 0, \\quad h_i(t) = h^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that each driver maintains a steady-state headway corresponding to their speed $v_i = v(h^*)$ contingent on the chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- In SRM: at equilibrium, the relative speed vanishes; thus, any constant headway with equal speeds across vehicles represents equilibrium\n",
    "- In SDM: equilibrium requires maintaining a desired time headway\n",
    "- In OVM: equilibrium speed depends on headway through v = v(h).\n",
    "- In IDM: the steady-state spacing satisfies h^* = h_0 + vT,\n",
    "which directly links desired time headway T to equilibrium density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability of equilibrium is a central research focus: small perturbations (e.g., a driver braking slightly) may either dissipate (stable flow) or amplify (unstable, leading to stop-and-go waves). Linear stability analysis is often applied to identify parameter regions where phantom jams emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellular Automata (CA) provide a discrete-time, discrete-space simulation paradigm for microscopic traffic. Unlike continuous car-following models (SRM/SDM/OVM/IDM) that specify behavioral equations in continuous variables (x, v, a), CA implements rule-based updates on a lattice of cells with synchronous time-stepping. CA can emulate different behavioral families by appropriate choice of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Road space: a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ cells, each of length $L_c$ (m).  \n",
    "- Time: discrete step $\\Delta t$ (s).  \n",
    "- Vehicle state: front-cell index $x_i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,L-1\\}$, integer speed $v_i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,v_{\\max}\\}$ in cells per step, (optional) length $\\ell_i$ (cells; often $\\ell_i=1$).  \n",
    "- Headway (gap): number of empty cells in front of vehicle $i$: $g_i = (x_{\\text{leader}(i)} - x_i - \\ell_i) \\bmod L \\quad \\text{(periodic boundary)}$\n",
    "- Unit mapping to continuous quantities: $v^{(\\text{m/s})} = v^{(\\text{cells/step})}\\cdot\\frac{L_c}{\\Delta t}, \\qquad a^{(\\text{m/s}^2)} \\approx \\frac{L_c}{\\Delta t^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These mappings allow alignment between CA parameters and continuous car-following quantities (e.g., choosing $v_{\\max}\\cdot L_c/\\Delta t \\approx v_0$ in IDM-like scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In the next lecture, we will develop the psuedocode of Cellular Automata along with its implementation in Python to emulate emergent traffic flow behavior.\n",
