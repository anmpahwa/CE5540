    "This lecture introduces hypothesis testing—a framework for making decisions between competing hypotheses under uncertainty. These hypotheses are typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The null hypothesis ($H_o$): the default or status quo assumption, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): the competing claim we seek to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in hypothesis testing is the power of a test (denoted by \\beta), which refers to the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. In contrast, failing to reject a false null hypothesis results in a Type II error, which occurs with probability 1 − \\beta. Further, the test might reject a true null hypothesis, resulting in a Type I error. The probability of this error is denoted by \\alpha and is also called the significance level of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal test is therefore one that strikes a balance: it keeps the significance level (\\alpha) low to minimize Type I errors, while maintaining high power (\\beta) to reduce Type II errors. However, in practice, there's often a trade-off between the two, and thus hypothesis tests must have contextual signficance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Airport Security: Consider a metal detector employed at an airport to detect the presence of weapons. In this context, the null hypothesis refers to the assumption that the passenger is not carrying a weapon, while the alternative hypothesis is that the passenger is carrying a weapon. A Type I error occurs when an innocent passenger is incorrectly flagged, causing unnecessary alarm and delay. A Type II error occurs when a dangerous passenger is not detected, posing a significant security threat. Therefore, in this scenario, it is generally preferable to tolerate more Type I errors than to risk a high Type II error, since the consequences of failing to detect a weapon are far more severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justic System: In a legal trial, the null hypothesis assumes that the defendant is innocent, while the alternative hypothesis asserts that the defendant is guilty. A Type I error corresponds to convicting an innocent person, while a Type II error means acquitting someone who is guilty. Most legal systems prioritize minimizing Type I errors, reflecting the foundational principle that it is better to let a guilty person go free than to wrongly convict an innocent one.\n",

    "Context: According to regulatory standards issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), all new passenger vehicles sold on or after July 1, 2019, must be equipped with a speed warning system. This system emits intermittent beeps when the vehicle exceeds 80 km/h, and a continuous beep when the speed crosses 120 km/h. Formulate a hypothesis test to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy using high-speed crash data for vehicles with and without such a warning system.\n",
